    "Please follow the steps in the [Using TF-Agents to Beat Breakout](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/18_reinforcement_learning.ipynb#Using-TF-Agents-to-Beat-Breakout) section above, replacing `\"Breakout-v4\"` with `\"SpaceInvaders-v4\"`. There will be a few things to tweak, however. For example, the Space Invaders game does not require the user to press FIRE to begin the game. Instead, the player's laser cannon blinks for a few seconds then the game starts automatically. For better performance, you may want to skip this blinking phase (which lasts about 40 steps) at the beginning of each episode and after each life lost. Indeed, it's impossible to do anything at all during this phase, and nothing moves. One way to do this is to use the following custom environment wrapper, instead of the `AtariPreprocessingWithAutoFire` wrapper:"

    "Moreover, you should always ensure that the preprocessed images contain enough information to play the game. For example, the blasts from the laser cannon and from the aliens should still be visible despite the limited resolution. In this particular case, the preprocessing we did for Breakout still works fine for Space Invaders, but that's something you should always check if you want try other games. To do this, you can let the agent play randomly for a while, and record the preprocessed frames, then play the animation and ensure the game still looks playable.\n",

    "You will also need to let the agent train for quite a long time to get good performance. Sadly, the DQN algorithm is not able to reach superhuman level on Space Invaders, likely because humans are able to learn efficient long term strategies in this game, whereas DQN can only master fairly short strategies. But there has been a lot of progress over the past few years, and now many other RL algorithms are able to surpass human experts at this game.
