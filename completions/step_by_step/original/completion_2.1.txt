 

1. We need to import the necessary libraries for this task. We will need numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and manipulation, and sklearn for the support vector machine regressor.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.svm import SVR

2. Next, we need to load in the dataset. We can do this using pandas.

housing = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/')

3. Now, let's take a look at the dataset.

housing.head()

4. We need to split the data into training and test sets. We will use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(housing, housing['price'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

5. Now, we can train the support vector machine regressor. We will use the kernel="linear" option.

svr_linear = SVR(kernel='linear')
svr_linear.fit(X_train, y_train)

6. Let's see how well the model performs on the training data.

y_pred_linear = svr_linear.predict(X_train)

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

mse_linear = mean_squared_error(y_train, y_pred_linear)

print('Mean squared error: %.2f' % mse_linear)

7. Now, let's see how well the model performs on the test data.

y_pred_linear = svr_linear.predict(X_test)

mse_linear = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_linear)

print('Mean squared error: %.2f' % mse_linear)

8. We can also use the kernel="rbf" option.

svr_rbf = SVR(kernel='rbf')
svr_rbf.fit(X_train, y_train)

9. Let's see how well the model performs on the training data.

y_pred_rbf = svr_rbf.predict(X_train)

mse_rbf = mean_squared_error(y_train, y_pred_rbf)

print('Mean squared error: %.2f' % mse_rbf)

10. Now, let's see how well the model performs on the test data.

y_pred_rbf = svr_rbf.predict(X_test)

mse_rbf = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_rbf)

print('Mean squared error: %.2f' % mse_rbf)
